A MATLAB wrapper for solving DenseCRF problems [1,2]. 
The code uses the c++ library provided with [2].

Getting started
---
* Setup a C++ compiler in MATLAB using `mex -setup`, you will need to have a supported compiler installed, see [https://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers.html](https://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers.html) for a list
* To solve a general problem see examples/example.m
* To perform segmentation on the MSRC-21 database using the unary potentials from [http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/densecrf/unary/](http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/densecrf/unary/) see examples/example_MSRC.m

Included solvers
--
* Mean field approximation, using approximate filtering [2]
* Mean field approximation, performing all summations explicitly (slow)
* TRWS-S [3]
* Graph cuts for 2 label problems [4]
